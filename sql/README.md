Using **SQLite**

You can install **Sqlite3 DB Browser** from [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/), and then import **`./data/aocDB.file`** into DB browser to check queries and paly width data;

**`aocDB.file`** is created using code `data/create_sqlitedb_file.py` and populated with data using code `data/populate_sqlite_file.py` (both codes perhaps could be optimized);
